Artificial Intelligence in Modern Computing

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century. It encompasses various techniques and approaches that enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn and make decisions from data. Key types include:

1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through interaction and rewards

Deep Learning

Deep Learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns. It has revolutionized:
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Recognition
- Autonomous Systems

Applications

AI is now widely used in:
- Healthcare: Diagnostic imaging, drug discovery
- Finance: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading
- Transportation: Autonomous vehicles, route optimization
- Entertainment: Recommendation systems, content generation

Future Prospects
